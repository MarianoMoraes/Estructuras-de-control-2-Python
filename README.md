# Exercise of control structures with Python.


- Exercise 1
The exercise consists of creating a program that classifies a numeric variable according to the scale Suspès/Aprovat/Notable/Excel-lent.

Remember that Suspès < 5, Aprovat > 5 and < 7, Notable > 7 and < 9 and Excel-lent > 9.


- Exercise 2

Using the following tutorial create a program that asks you for two numbers. It should display a message telling you if the first is larger, the second is larger or they are the same.




- Exercise 3

Create a program that asks for your name, and asks for a number. If the number is 0, it should display an error message. Otherwise, it should display the name repeated as many times as the number indicates. For example, "Joan Joan Joan".






- Exercise 4

Create a program that, given any list, will tell you if it is symmetric or not. If it is, it will tell you how many elements it has.






- Exercise 5Create a program that, given a list, tells you how many numbers match its position. For example [3,4,2,0,2,2,3,6] the 2 and the 6 coincide.
